# Where did this app come from?

Hello, This is my new project.   
Origin story of the project actually is completly personal. I can't say that i am good researcher but when i have intended to research any topic, After some progress I have gave up halfway and it have been inconclusive.  
This is because sometimes i lose my will. but I think the main reason is that the research is growing slowly and I am moving away from the main point and it is unmanageable after a point. Besides, it's because I lost some traces of the past because it is a very costly process to go back and find those traces.  

To solve these problems and more, i have decided to built an app, personal research tool. My first purpose is to make more efficent research for my personal area but also i want to share this app and convert to an open source project in future.  
\
The project have 2 basic pillar, board and card. Board allows you to entitle main subject. Besides, Board allows you to set boundaries and to be well-defined topic. These help you much to conclude any research.
Cards is an element that board have. It is like subtopics. Card allows you to split main issue to parts and it make main topic more managable. Also, Every card have own characteristic features. Some make it easier for you to manage images, while others make it easier for you to manage links. In addition with these, it is so helpfull to trace past.

This is short story of how i decide to start this project and where it comes from. I will explain these and more with details in the future.

# Status Of Project

This project is incomplete. It is not ready for end-user. It have many missing like basic ui feature or technical backend parts(such as signup,login,logout system)  
In addition, There are many concepts that have not been implemented. While I am not sure how much some of them is necessary, I see many areas for improvement in my project.

My precedence is to complete basic need for now.
